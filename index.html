    <p>A survey conducted in 2014 using SurveyMonkey Audience was made on Star Wars movies and about 1188 people were surveyed.</p>

    <p>Using LibraOffice and Google Sheets, I looked over the information provided from the survey to create my own charts based on different questions about the Star Wars movies. </p>
